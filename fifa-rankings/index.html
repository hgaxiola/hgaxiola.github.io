<h1>THE WORLD'S GAME</h1>


<p>By: Herbert Gaxiola Lopez</p>


<h2>What is going on around the world?</h2>
<div class ="divider"></div>
<P>
    Although football (soccer) is considered one of the most accessible and popular sports on the planet, the success of every country 
    at the highest international levels varies - with only a handful of countries performing at the highest level consistently. 
    As we can see, football is the most popular sport by a large margin- the vast majority of countries have the most football fans. 
    The second largest sport is cricket, and football still clears cricketâ€™s global popularity. 
</P>
<p>
    The world is full of soccer players and fans, but somehow we have only seen two continents produce world champions. Countries like China, 
    Russia, and Mexico have great populations but no international success. Perhaps there are some deeper reasons behind why some countries are
    much more successful than others.

<h2>
    Regional Differences
</h2>
<div class ="divider"></div>
<p>
The graphics below breaks down the official FIFA rankings by region. To produce this graphic, we found the average points in each of the 
confederations and compared them to each other in which we see that there are  two clear leaders: CONMEBOL (South America) and UEFA (Europe). 
These two regions happen to be the only that have produced world cup winners in 22 editions of the tournament.
</p>
<p>
This is paired with a graphic showing the amount of world cup wins per country. There have only been 8 world cup winners: Brazil, Argentina,
Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Uruguay, and England. Some of these teams have won the World Cup multiple times: Brazil has won it 5 times,
Argentina has won three, France has won two, four for Germany, and four for Italy. 
</p>




<h2>History</h2>
<div class ="divider"></div>
<p>
    However, when looking at the age of the oldest club in each country that has played in a world cup, we get a better understanding of this 
    phenomenon (need to find a better vis for this)
